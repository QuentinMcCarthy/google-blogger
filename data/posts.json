During dry months, many Grevy's zebras migrate to greener mountain pastures, but males on prime territories often remain there year-round. Grevy's zebras inhabit semi-desert areas, including arid grasslands and dusty acacia savannas. The most suitable areas have water year-round.</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\n</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h9hNe3xHZeU/TlSiguEhLiI/AAAAAAAACbw/P_WmUV3IcTE/s1600/true-wildlife-grevy+zebra-5.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"318\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h9hNe3xHZeU/TlSiguEhLiI/AAAAAAAACbw/P_WmUV3IcTE/s400/true-wildlife-grevy+zebra-5.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a> </div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\n</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Normally only one <b>foal </b>is born to a female after a gestation period of thirteen months. Most of the babies are born between May and August. The young zebra has brown stripes and a mane which stretches from the shoulder to the tail. The background colour of the foal's coat is light brown instead of white. This protective colouring helps the foal to \"freeze\" and blend instantly with its background. The foal can stand on its feet within one hour of its birth and can run with the herd after only a few hours - this gives it a much better chance of escaping from predators, usually lions. Young males leave the herd when they are about two years old and join bachelor herds. Eventually they will collect mares to form their own new herds or perhaps challenge old or weak stallions and take over their herd.</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\n</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eegI3n2B36k/TlSjGsf7yOI/AAAAAAAACb0/qQtQ3u97xs8/s1600/true-wildlife-grevy+zebra-6.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"266\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eegI3n2B36k/TlSjGsf7yOI/AAAAAAAACb0/qQtQ3u97xs8/s400/true-wildlife-grevy+zebra-6.jpg\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\n</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Today, the surviving wild Grevy's Zebras are <b>protected </b>in national parks.

Its living space is also disappearing because people are building.

Herds of 1,000 or more Asian Wild Asses have often been observed in Central and West Asia. Like many other large grazing animals, the asian wild ass' range has contracted greatly under the pressures of hunting and habitat loss, and of the six subspecies, one is <b>extinct </b>and two are <b>endangered</b>. The kiang , a Tibetan relative, was previously considered to be a subspecies of the asian wild ass as E. hemionus kiang, but recent molecular studies indicate that it is a distinct species.&nbsp;</div><a name='more'></a><br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cLHINkQGJOw/TlSc01qPWPI/AAAAAAAACbU/y3ZywC6rmPo/s1600/true-wildlife-asian+wild+ass-2.JPG\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"287\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cLHINkQGJOw/TlSc01qPWPI/AAAAAAAACbU/y3ZywC6rmPo/s400/true-wildlife-asian+wild+ass-2.JPG\" width=\"400\" /></a> </div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\n</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Asian Wild Ass </b>are a little larger than donkeys at about 290 kilograms&nbsp; and 2.1 metres , and are a little more <b>horse-like</b>.

Conservation efforts have helped them recover their population in some areas, but as a whole, the Asian Wild Ass is still an endangered species.<br />\n</div>","author":{"id":"11722075278938383066","displayName":"Ando","url":"https://www.blogger.com/profile/11722075278938383066","image":{"url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/4236176886935208807/posts/5376309453894576881/comments"},"labels":["Endangered","Herbivore","Horse","Mammal"]}],"etag":"\"iHf3yWDE_geBgZ8U7rgZ_xuTeAQ/MjAxMy0wNS0zMVQxMzozNjoxMi40OTla\""}
